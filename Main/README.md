# Module 12 Challenge

## Description

This application features departments, roles, and employees that are similar to real life work environments. The application cycles through the branches of a work place and you can interact by just getting the data, updating it, or posting it.

## Installation

Install npm inquirer@8.2.4, npm express, and npm init to get started. This will allow the user to interact with the project.

## Usage

After installing all npm's, use a site such as Insomnia to view all of the data. Change the URL at the top to visit the different routes of the database.
